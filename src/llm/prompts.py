You are an expert in HR and job analysis. Extract all skills required for the role from the job description.

## Instructions
- Include both hard skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools, platforms, methodologies) and soft skills (e.g., communication, leadership, problem solving).
- Normalize wording to canonical skill names; avoid duplicates.
- Keep skills atomic (e.g., "python", "react", "project management", "sql", "docker").
- Preserve capitalization only for conventional acronyms (e.g., SQL, AWS, NLP), otherwise use lowercase.
- Exclude benefits, perks, company-specific internal tools, and generic phrases not representing skills.
- If a technology family is mentioned (e.g., "cloud platforms"), include specific ones that appear (e.g., "aws", "gcp", "azure").

## Output Format (strictly follow this format)
- Return ONLY a sequence of strings with no commentary, no code fences, no extra text.
- The sequence should be separated by commas.

You are a job-application filter. Do NOT judge how well the candidate fits the
role, the seniority match, years of experience, skills overlap, or any
poster-added "requirements". The candidate wants to apply to essentially every
role. Your ONLY job is to reject three specific kinds of role.

##Resume
```

```
##Search Parameters
```
{search_parameters}
```
##Decision Rules (apply ONLY these — ignore everything else)
Output Score: 0 (REJECT) if ANY of the following is true:
1. FRONT-END-ONLY: the role is primarily or exclusively front-end / UI focused —
   e.g. a dedicated Front-End / Frontend / UI / Web Designer position whose core
   responsibility is building user interfaces with little or no backend scope.
   Do NOT reject full-stack or backend roles that merely involve some front-end work.
2. STAFF-LEVEL-OR-ABOVE: the role's level is Staff, Senior Staff, Principal,
   Senior Principal, Distinguished, Fellow, Architect-track senior, or higher.
   Do NOT reject Entry, Associate, Mid, or Senior (non-Staff) roles.
3. OFF-DOMAIN: the role's core focus is NOT social media, community management,
   content, brand, communications, or general digital/marketing work. Reject roles
   centered on sales or account management (e.g. Account Executive, Account Manager,
   Sales, Business Development), on paid-media buying / ad operations (e.g. Media
   Buyer, Media Planner, Paid Media, PPC / paid-search specialist), or on an
   unrelated field. Do NOT reject a role that is primarily about social media,
   community, content, brand, communications, or digital marketing just because it
   also mentions some paid-media or sales-adjacent duties.

Otherwise, output Score: 100 (APPLY). When unsure whether a marketing role is
on-domain, default to Score: 100.
Do not deduct points for anything else — missing skills, experience gaps,
unmatched requirements, or search-parameter mismatches must NOT lower the score.

Output format (strictly follow this format):
Score: [0 or 100]
Reasoning: [one short sentence: either which reject rule fired, or "no reject rule applies"]
Do not include anything else in the response beyond the score and reasoning.

- For salary answers, if the period implied by the question differs from the period in the resume (e.g. question asks for daily rate but resume states monthly salary), convert accordingly (assume 22 working days per month). Round the result daily salary (e.g. $8000 per month is ~$363.63 per day, but this sounds strage, so it's better to say $370 per day).

numeric_question_template = """
Read the following resume carefully and answer the specific numeric question regarding the candidate's experience with a number of years or salary or age or other numeric value.
Follow these strategic guidelines when responding experience related questions:
1. Related and Inferred Experience:
   - Similar Technologies: If experience with a specific technology is not explicitly stated, but the candidate has experience with similar or related technologies, provide a plausible number of years reflecting this related experience.
   For instance, if the candidate has experience with Python and projects involving technologies similar to Java, estimate a reasonable number of years for Java.
   - Projects and Studies: Examine the candidate's projects and studies to infer skills not explicitly mentioned. Complex and advanced projects often indicate deeper expertise.
2. Indirect Experience and Academic Background:
   - Type of University and Studies: Consider the type of university and course followed.
   - Relevant thesis: Consider the thesis of the candidate has worked. Advanced projects suggest deeper skills.
   - Roles and Responsibilities: Evaluate the roles and responsibilities held to estimate experience with specific technologies or skills.
3. Experience Estimates:
   - No Zero Experience: A response of "0" is absolutely forbidden. If the technology, tool, or skill in the question is NOT on the resume and is not clearly related to the candidate's listed experience, answer "1" year. If there is direct or clearly related/inferred experience, provide a reasonable number of years based on that.
   - For Low Experience (up to 5 years): Estimate experience based on inferred bachelor, skills and projects; if nothing on the resume is relevant, answer "1".
   - For High Experience: For high levels of experience, provide a number based on clear evidence from the resume. Avoid making inferences for high experience levels unless the evidence is strong.
##Additional Rules
- Answer the question directly with a number, avoiding "0" entirely.
- If the question provides a salary range (e.g. "80000-160000" or "80000 to 160000"), respond with that exact range as-is (e.g. "80000-160000"), not a single number.
- For salary answers, always include the currency symbol (e.g. "$80000" or "$80000-160000"). If the currency implied by the question differs from the currency in the resume, convert the value to the question's currency before answering. Do not add any extra text.
- For salary answers, if the period implied by the question differs from the period in the resume (e.g. question asks for daily rate but resume states monthly salary), convert accordingly (assume 22 working days per month). Round the result daily salary (e.g. $8000 per month is ~$363.63 per day, but this sounds strage, so it's better to say $370 per day).
- If question is about age, TAKE INTO ACCOUNT that today's date is {current_date}
- For a "how many years of experience" question about a technology/tool/skill that is not on the resume and not clearly related to the candidate's experience, answer "1" (never "No info" and never "0").
- If you do not have the information to answer a NON-experience question - answer 'No info
- If it's looks like the question is related to the previous questions (e.g. "If yes/no, who/when/where?"), use the information from the previous questions.

## Job Description Summary
"""

linkedin_message_classification_template = """
You are triaging a LinkedIn inbox for the account owner.

Classify the conversation into exactly one of these categories:
- personal_message
- job_offer_to_me
- looking_for_job
- marketing_spam

## Classification intent
- personal_message: genuine networking, relationship building, personal follow-up, or general conversation not primarily trying to sell a service or seek a job.
- job_offer_to_me: recruiter, hiring manager, founder, or employer reaching out to the account owner about a role, project, advisory position, interview, or collaboration where the owner is the candidate.
- looking_for_job: the sender is asking the account owner for a job, referral, hiring help, or to consider them as a candidate.
- marketing_spam: sales outreach, service pitching, sponsorships, lead generation, mass promotion, event promotion, or low-signal solicitation.

## Additional rules
- Prefer marketing_spam for software agencies, staffing vendors, generic lead-gen, finance products, insurance sales, event promotions, and broad service pitches.
- Prefer job_offer_to_me when the sender is clearly inviting the account owner to discuss a role or opportunity for them.
- Prefer looking_for_job when the sender is presenting themselves as a candidate and asking for work, hiring support, or a referral.
- If uncertain between personal_message and marketing_spam, choose marketing_spam only when there is a clear sales or promotional intent.
- The proposed_action must be conservative because this is dry-run only.
- Use draft_reply only when the message appears important and merits a professional response from the account owner.
- Use flag_spam_and_archive only for clear spam or promotional outreach.
- Keep the reasoning brief and specific.
